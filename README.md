# Efficient Discovery of Azoarene Photoswitches with Active Search and Quantumn Chemical Calculations

(Under review.)

## Requirements

Gaussian16

Access to a High Performance Computing Cluster

Matlab: [https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

Python 3: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
- Further required libraries are included in `requirements.txt`.

## Data generation

The molecular library was generated using RDKit implemented in the pymolgen.py script. 

## Active search

Subdirectory `active_search` contains code that implements our active search algorithm.
Please refer to its `README.md` file for more details.

## Quantumn calculations
Quantum chemical calculations were performed using PyFlow [https://github.com/kuriba/PyFlow]
